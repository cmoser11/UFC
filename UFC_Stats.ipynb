    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most pervasive controversies in fighting is weight cutting. Fighters are divided into weight classes that they choose to fight in for the sake of fairness. However, fighters have realized they can gain a massive advantadge by temporarily reducing their weight through water cutting, the process of temporarily losing weight through sweat, to make weight classes that otherwise would be impossible for their body composition. Fighters have been known to regain up to 20 lbs between weigh in and fight night, with the highest ever gain from Geoff Neal, who gained 30.3 pounds at UFC 298 (https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/39610394/seven-ufc-298-fighters-flagged-rehydration-issue). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since weigh-ins are done the day before fights, fighters can then recover the lost water and go back to their \"real\" weight by fight night. The advantadge of weight cutting, especially against an opponent who cuts less, is drastic. Fighters that weigh more hit harder, can more easily smother their opponents in wrestling, and can have a signficant reach advantadge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this signficant advantadge from weight cutting, fighting has increasingly become a game of who can cut the most weight. On one hand, this phenomenon hurts the sport by making fighting skill less important to the overall equation. Some fighters who may be less skilled but their bodies are naturally adapted to rapidly losing and gaining water weight. Ultimately, this hurts spectators when fights become \"weight-bullying\" contests rather than tests of skill and ability. Furthermore, exciting fights can get cancelled from fighters failing to make weight from attempting too large of a weight cut, or even having to pull out due to health complications from bad water cuts (https://www.mmamania.com/2022/9/9/23345292/ufc-279-dana-white-reveals-khamzat-chimaevs-weight-cut-ended-after-locking-and-cramping). Even more concerning is the danger that comes with weight cutting. Fighters have been known to not only have serious health complications frmo bad weight cuts, but even have died from it (https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/14344041/chinese-mma-fighter-yang-jian-bing-dies-trying-make-weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this isue, organizations such as One Championship, a rival organization to the UFC, has implemented measuresn such as measuring hydration levels post weigh in to ensure fighters are not cutting too much water weight. However, the UFC, the biggest and most popular MMA organization in the world, currently has no such measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to how pervasive weight cutting has become, it is important to investigagte how crucial weight cutting has become to fighting. In this study, I intend to investiage the impact weight cutting has on the odds of winning fights.\n"

    "- Weight regain percentage: To measure a fighter's weight cut, I have made a variable called PERCENT_REGAIN. This variable is the percentage change between a fighter's weigh-in weight and their fight weight the next day. This fight-night weight is unforuntately not universal across UFC events because not every region measures it. For example, the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) measures fight night weight for the purposes of regulat(heavyweights more likely to just have higher raw numbers because they have more fat than lower weight classes)"

To explore this effect, I have done seperate regressions below by weight class."

    "- Interesting results:\n",

    "- Most significant results were at Middlweight and Heavyweight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For fighters in the Middleweight division, every 1 percent increase in weight is linked to a 1.83 change in odds of winning. In other words, a 1% increase in weight regained following fight-weigh in is is linked to a 83% increase in odds of winning a fight. This result is statistically signficant at a 95% confidence level. Intutitively, this increase in odds makes sense because of the Middleweight division's relative position compared to other weight classes. Many of the competitive middleweights, such as Alex Pereira who is 6\"4 and walks around at 220+ pounds, are big enough to fight in the light-heavyweight division. These fighters that make the cut to middleweight are signficantly bigger than their competitors at middleweight. Typically, fighters in the middleweight division are not big enough to fight in light-heavyweight and have even previously fought in Welterweight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For fighters in the Heavyweight division, every 1 percent increase in weight is linked to a 4.99 change in odds of winning. In other words, a 1% increase in weight regained following fight-weigh in is is linked to an approximate 500% increase in odds of winning a fight. This result is statistically signficant at a 90% confidence level. Since this model has a pseudo R$^{2}$ value of 0.25, there is a strong relationship between percentage of weight regained and the odds of winning for heavyweight fighters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The result for heavyweight went against my initial intution because I assumed that heavyweights have the least to gain from cutting weight, since they are already in the highest weight class. However, the implication for heavyweights who cut is that they are in better physical conditioning and regain the be even bigger. Typically weight cutting is not as prevalent at heavyweight because of the fact it is the max weight class, leading to many in the division having poorer conditioning relative to other weight classes. In this way, the heavyweight fighters that do cut weight unlike their competitors have a signficant advantadge. This can be seen in fighters like Francis Ngannou who are in heavyweight but are in considerably better physical shape compared to their competitors like Derrick Lewis or Daniel Cormier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Middlewight-> people like Alex Perriera cutting massive amounts of weight (fighters who should be at light heavy or heavy weight cutting to make it to middle weight.)"
