    "- Initial intituation on fighting weight cuts\n",
    "- Fighters have cut drastic amounts of weight to get advantadge through rehydraiton. By cutting water weight before a fight, fighters can weigh in at their desired weight class then regain that weight before their fight through rapid rehydtation. Fighters have been known to regain up to 20 lbs between weigh in and fight night, with the highest ever gain from Geoff Neal, who gained 30.3 pounds at UFC 298 (https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/39610394/seven-ufc-298-fighters-flagged-rehydration-issue)\n",
    "- Huge advandtadge to cutting weight: you have a massive size advantadge on fight night compared to your opponent.\n",
    "- However, weight cutting turns the sport of fighting into a weight regain contest. Organizations like One Championship have tried to combat this by measuring hydration levels, but in the UFC, there are no such measures.\n",
    "- How much of an impact does weight cutting have on winning fights?\n",
    "- Implications of the sport: weight cutting gives adantadge to fighters who may be less skilled but their bodies are naturally adapted to rapidly losing and gaining water weight\n",
    "- Also a safety issue: fighters have died trying to cut too much water weight.\n",
    "- Point of this study is to see the extent to which regaining water weight affects the odds of a fighter winning."

Having more post fight weigh in data could let us more accurately assess if there is a limitation to the benefit of cutting and regaining weight."
