    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most pervasive controversies in fighting is weight cutting. Fighters are divided into weight classes that they choose to fight in for the sake of fairness. However, fighters have realized they can gain a massive advantadge by temporarily reducing their weight through water cutting, the process of temporarily losing weight through sweat, to make weight classes that otherwise would be impossible for their body composition. Fighters have been known to regain up to 20 lbs between weigh in and fight night, with the highest ever gain from Geoff Neal, who gained 30.3 pounds at UFC 298 (https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/39610394/seven-ufc-298-fighters-flagged-rehydration-issue). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since weigh-ins are done the day before fights, fighters can then recover the lost water and go back to their \"real\" weight by fight night. The advantadge of weight cutting, especially against an opponent who cuts less, is drastic. Fighters that weigh more hit harder, can more easily smother their opponents in wrestling, and can have a signficant reach advantadge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this signficant advantadge from weight cutting, fighting has increasingly become a game of who can cut the most weight. On one hand, this phenomenon hurts the sport by making fighting skill less important to the overall equation. Some fighters who may be less skilled but their bodies are naturally adapted to rapidly losing and gaining water weight. Ultimately, this hurts spectators when fights become \"weight-bullying\" contests rather than tests of skill and ability. Furthermore, exciting fights can get cancelled from fighters failing to make weight from attempting too large of a weight cut, or even having to pull out due to health complications from bad water cuts (https://www.mmamania.com/2022/9/9/23345292/ufc-279-dana-white-reveals-khamzat-chimaevs-weight-cut-ended-after-locking-and-cramping). Even more concerning is the danger that comes with weight cutting. Fighters have been known to not only have serious health complications frmo bad weight cuts, but even have died from it (https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/14344041/chinese-mma-fighter-yang-jian-bing-dies-trying-make-weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this isue, organizations such as One Championship, a rival organization to the UFC, has implemented measuresn such as measuring hydration levels post weigh in to ensure fighters are not cutting too much water weight. However, the UFC, the biggest and most popular MMA organization in the world, currently has no such measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to how pervasive weight cutting has become, it is important to investigagte how crucial weight cutting has become to fighting. In this study, I intend to investiage the impact weight cutting has on the odds of winning fights.\n"
